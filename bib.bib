 abstract = {This paper presents a semiparametric procedure to analyze the effects of institutional and labor market factors on recent changes in the U.S. distribution of wages. The effects of these factors are estimated by applying kernel density methods to appropriately weighted samples. The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.},

 abstract = {Many applications involve a decomposition of the mean intergroup difference in a given variable into the portion attributable to differences in the distribution of one or more explanatory variables and that due to differences in the conditional expectation function. This article notes two interrelated reasons why the Blinder-Oaxaca (B-O) method-the approach most commonly used in the literature-may yield misleading results. We suggest a natural solution that both provides a more reliable answer to the original problem and affords a richer examination of the sources of intergroup differences in the variable of interest. The conventional application of the B-O method requires a parametric assumption about the form of the conditional expectation function. Furthermore, it often uses estimates based on that functional form to extrapolate outside the range of the observed explanatory variables. We show that misspecification of the conditional expectation function is likely to result in nontrivial errors in inference regarding the portion attributable to differences in the distribution of explanatory variables, a problem compounded by the computation of conditional expectations outside the observed range of the conditioning variables. Here we propose a nonparametric alternative to the B-O method that reweights the empirical distribution of the outcome variable using weights that equalize the empirical distributions of the explanatory variable. We apply this method to the role of earnings in explaining the black-white wealth difference. The problems with the B-O method show up clearly in this application, because the function relating wealth to earnings is highly nonlinear (with a functional form unspecified by theory) and because the earnings distribution for blacks is shifted sharply to the left of that for whites. We argue that it is not possible to examine the hypothetical distribution of black wealth holdings conditional on the observed white earnings function. For the question that we can answer-the distribution of wealth for a synthetic sample of blacks and whites with comparable earnings-we find that two-thirds of the mean difference in wealth can appropriately be attributed to earnings. In addition, we fully characterize the distribution of white and black wealth conditional on earnings.},

We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to selection bias that is not ruled out by the parallel trends assumption. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these TWFE drawbacks, and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.},

The alternative contracts yield large welfare gains, which are robust to assumptions about the behavior of the lenders and borrower preferences. The gains are similar to those that could come from the debt relief program currently being considered in the U.S., but without its adverse fiscal implications.},

A calibration exercise estimates that the flypaper effect makes forbearance less effective and more costly as a counter-cyclical fiscal tool.},

Up to \$442 billion in loans were eligible. Those who would have benefited most were younger, had lower credit scores, and lived in lower- and middle-income neighborhoods. We also find that Black and Hispanic borrowers would have disproportionately benefited from the proposal. We then compare the distribution of beneficiaries for the proposed policy to several alternative hypothetical forgiveness proposals and three existing tax credits. The additional forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients increased the progressivity of the policy at a cost of \$129 billion. Reducing the income eligibility criterion in half from the proposal would have reduced the cost by nearly \$100 billion and made the policy more progressive. Compared with existing tax credits, the announced forgiveness policy is less progressive than the Earned Income Tax Credit but more progressive than the 2019 Child Tax Credit and higher education tax credits. We conclude with a discussion of how each policy lever affects the progressivity of loan cancellation to help inform future policy.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the rise in student loan default and delinquency. It draws on a unique set of administrative data on federal student borrowing matched to earnings records from de-identified tax records. Most of the increase in default is associated with borrowers at for-profit schools, 2-year institutions, and certain other nonselective institutions. Historically, students at these institutions have constituted a small share of all student borrowers. These nontraditional borrowers have largely come from lower-income families, attended institutions with relatively weak educational outcomes, faced poor labor market outcomes after leaving school, and defaulted at high rates. In contrast, default rates have remained low among borrowers who attended most 4-year public and nonprofit private institutions and among graduate school borrowers—who collectively represent the vast majority of the federal loan portfolio—despite the severe recession and these borrowers' relatively high loan balances. The higher earnings, low rates of unemployment, and greater family resources of this latter category of borrowers appear to have helped them avoid adverse loan outcomes even during times of hardship. Decomposition analysis indicates that changes in the characteristics of borrowers and the institutions they attended are associated with much of the doubling in default rates between 2000 and 2011, with changes in the type of schools attended, debt burdens, and labor market outcomes explaining the largest share.},
